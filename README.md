# Word Scrapper

Word scrapper is a basic tool that gathers grammatical information about the word that is specified.

### 📝 TODO:

- Show the references of words from the original website that word is fetched from.
- Bulk search mode.
- Display word formation that is linked to the definition.
- More propper word formation ui.
- Rewrite whole back-end with python.

### 🐛 Known Bug(s):

- May display the wrong first definition when the input word is tensed.
- Sometimes it does not find a word that is valid.
